The Julia code in MatpowerCases.jl is distributed under the MIT license, a copy of which is produced below. The .mat files containing transmission network data were generated, via MATLAB, from .m files contained in MATPOWER (whose license is also included below). These files are not covered by the GNU General Public License, nor are they covered by the MIT license I have applied to this project. The original network data was included in MATPOWER by permission or derived from public sources. Its presence here is predicated on fair use -- this package is for non-commercial, educational purposes. Mirroring this data has no effect on the commercial value of MATPOWER, which is itself an open-source, education-oriented software package.

Two of the .mat files (case96 and case79) were generated using .m files from Zhu Wang and Robert Green (these files are not included in MATPOWER). The license for these files is reproduced below, as required.
